About Me
Hi Ther! I'm Adrian, a proactive software developer with a passion for writing efficient and creative code.

First experience with C++ (2024) – Since then, I’ve been deeply involved in software development, currently working with Python and Java.
Training as an Application Developer – I’m pursuing further education to advance my career and refine my skills.
Hands-on Projects – I’ve built small applications, worked on web projects, and experimented with Arduino and embedded systems.

I’m looking for an internship as an application developer to deepen my knowledge and take on real-world software challenges.
